# Caro Game

## Overview
Caro, also known as Gomoku or Five in a Row, is a traditional board game that is widely popular in many cultures. The game is simple yet challenging, requiring strategic thinking and planning. The objective is to align five of your pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Game Rules
1. **Players**: The game is played by two players. Each player has 15 seconds to play.
2. **Board**: The game is played on a grid. Typically, a 15x20 board is used.
3. **Pieces**: Each player has a set of pieces. One player uses X pieces, and the other uses O pieces.
4. **Objective**: The goal is to be the first player to get an unbroken row of five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns placing their pieces on an empty cell of the board.
   - The first player to align five of their pieces wins the game.
   - If the board is filled and no player has achieved five in a row, the game is considered a draw.
